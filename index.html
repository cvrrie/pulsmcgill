Not only did I make amazing friends on the council and in my program, but I also learned so much about running different programs and working as a team. PULS does a great job of bringing together the students of the physiology department, and truly made my experience at McGill so much fun. I miss my time on council a lot but I know that it’s in great hands! PULS truly cares for and works hard for the students in physiology, and the department wouldn’t be the same without it!"</p>

                        <p>Hello all! I’m Anna and I’m running to be next year’s President for PULS! I first joined PULS as a U1 rep, which was absolutely one of the best decisions I’ve made at McGill. PULS has come to stand in as my home away from home, and I’ve met some of the most amazing people I know at PULS or through PULS events. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            This year I served as VP Finance, where I managed PULS’s portfolio, mediated financial relations with SUS, and generated funding for all events PULS was involved in. I was lucky enough to closely work with all the members of PULS and collaborate with many departmental councils. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            What’s my plan for next if I’m elected as President? <br/>
                            1.	Accessible and open communication between the faculty, the students and PULS<br/>
                            a.	Feedback forms for academic and general Physiology issues<br/>
                            2.	Strengthened interdepartmental relations through collaborative events and increasing visibility of existing resources and opportunities outside of Physiology <br/>
                            a.	Promoting interdepartmental event collaboration<br/>
                            b.	Visibility of out-of-department and McGill-wide opportunities and events<br/>
                            3.	Supporting the Physiology community and connections <br/>
                            a.	Accessible, timely and varied U-events<br/>
                            b.	Expansion of the U3-U1 Synapse mentoring program <br/>
                            <br/>
                            If you have any questions/comments/concerns or just want to get in touch with me, please feel free to post a comment or personally message me – I would love to hear from everyone and will respond ASAP!

                        <p> Hi everyone, my name is Léo Han and I am running to be your Vice President of PULS for the
                            2020-21 academic year of physiology.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Ultimately, my goal with this position is to serve the student body and PULS members from a
                            leadership standpoint, to better the physiology student community and its relationship with
                            departmental faculty members.
                            <br/><br/>

                            In the past year, I have gotten to know many of you through academic and social events such as
                            PHGY Survival Guide, crawls, intramural games and more. My wish is to make resources and
                            such awesome events more accessible to everyone. Simply put, this would mean ensuring that
                            core services such as office hours and NTC’s are able to be reliably depended upon and keeping
                            the works of the council organized and efficient as possible.
                            <br/><br/>

                            The experience that I had as a U1 Rep this past year has brought me much joy in knowing the
                            work and the positive impact that PULS can have on the physiology community. From
                            organizing U-events to assisting people during office hours, I learned a lot about helping the
                            community and making new connections. That is why I am running to be your next Vice
                            President, to help PULS facilitate even more great encounters between fellow physiology
                            students, while providing all the academic resources that PULS can so that you can have the best
                            experience as a physiology student here at McGill.
                            <br/><br/>

                            Thank you so much for reading my platform and I sincerely hope that you will consider me as
                            your next Vice President of PULS!

                            I am currently in U2 physiology and have served as the PULS U2 representative for the 2019-2020 academic school year. My experience on PULS has been extremely rewarding and I would love the opportunity to continue to represent, advocate, and bond with the physiology student community. Serving as the PULS U2 representative has taught me essential skills involving responsibility, commitment, and teamwork, all of which are imperative to success as VP Finance. Furthermore, for the past two years I have acted as VP Research for the student run club, “The Student Research Initiative”, on campus. My role as VP research requires a great level of organizational skills, professionalism, and leadership.
                            
                            As VP Finance, I promise reliability, accountability, and transparency. I plan to work cooperatively and effectively with both SUS and the PULS council to ensure efficiency and responsibility with the finances of the physiology community. Furthermore, I want to collaborate with the VP internal in order to work to provide sponsorship opportunities to ensure accessibility to all students to PULS events.

                            Youth Outreach Program 2018-2019<br/>
                            <br/><br/>

                            If elected, my primary focus would be the following: 
                            <br/>

                            1.	Inclusivity: <br/>
                            I believe it’s important to celebrate diversity and develop a community built on respect. Therefore, I will be working towards hosting more non-alcoholic events (such as ceramics café and café crawl), as well as providing celiac/non-alcoholic options at all drinking events. All venues will be picked with accessibility in mind, prioritizing gender neutral bathrooms and wheelchair accessibility. Additionally, I will ensure that Red Frogs, DriveSafe, and MSERT will be available at all major events to make sure that everyone feels safe and welcomed.
                            <br/><br/>

                            2.	Financial accessibility: <br/>
                            We’re all students – paying to attend every single event is kinda just unrealistic for most. Working with VP Finance and Charity Director, I hope to provide bursaries for physiology events, such as crawls and our annual semi-formal, to ensure that we are as inclusive as possible!
                            <br/><br/>

                            3.	Expand event variety:<br/>
                            To engage Physiology/IHI students in all aspects of student life, I will be collaborating with the other council members to provide a larger variety of events to cater to all of those in our student body. While keeping our most popular events, such as PHGY Olympics and Crawl-o-ween (4.0?!), I will work to host non-alcoholic events as well as new initiatives that I have planned for the upcoming year, including an event for U3-U1 mentor-mentee bonding!

                        <p> My name is Malcolm Ryan and I am running to be your PULS VP of Athletics and Publicity for the 2020/2021 school year! I am currently in my third year of Physiology and I am excited for the opportunity to bring my novel ideas and unique experiences to the role. McGill Athletics has been an important aspect of my school life. Since my first year I have been an active participant in Volleyball intramurals, and I am extremely grateful for the friends I have had a chance to meet while staying active! For this reason, I am aware of the capacity of intramurals to bring the McGill Physiology community together. Whether its volleyball, dodgeball, or inner tube water polo I believe that Physiology students coming together outside of class can greatly strengthen our community and help us succeed in both our academic and extracurricular endeavors. Furthermore, I have many ideas for Physiology branded clothing and memorabilia next year. As the VP of Athletics and Publicity I would work towards adding things like socks, fanny packs, and slides to the Physiology clothing catalogue! These new additions would improve the merchandise selection and help you update your PHGY fit! Overall, I believe my roles on WWF McGill, and MCHAM executive teams in the past have prepared me for this position. Through them I have learned the importance of working collaboratively and effectively with my fellow council members in order achieve collective goals. Thanks for taking the time to read my campaign. I hope to be your VP of Athletics and Publicity next year!

                            As your U3 representative, I want to make sure that your U3 year goes as smoothly as possible. I had the honour of being your U2 representative this year, and I want to use all that I’ve learned to do an even better job of representing you next year.

                            Ensuring the distribution of quality NTCs for PATH 300 
                            
                            Next year, many of us will be taking PATH 300. As your U3 representative, it would be my priority to ensure that the NTCs for this course are delivered regularly and are of high quality. I have seen how the NTC process can be improved, and this insight is something I will bring to the role.

                            With all the large prerequisite courses behind us, it’s easy for us to feel disconnected from the physiology community. It is my goal to host at least one event per semester so that we can maintain of sense of camaraderie and connectedness throughout the year.

                            Grad dinner

                            We need one last “hurrah” before we end our undergraduacy here at McGill. As your U3 representative, I’ll ensure that our 2020-21 grad dinner is a night to remember. I will reach out to older U3s to learn about previous shortcomings and to avoid those same mistakes.

                            The U1s entering the physiology program need guidance. It’s up to us U3s to help guide these young ones and to show them the path to success. I will work to match U1s with like-minded U3s to help them thrive in PHGY.
                            
                            <br/><br/>
                            It would be an honour to be your representative again and I hope that together we can have an incredible U3!</p>

                            <br/><br/>
                            Now that we’ve (barely) survived our way through U2, I’m sure we’re ready to take some PHGY classes that don’t collectively ruin our chances of graduating :/ (lookin’ at you 311).
                            <br/><br/>
                            All jokes aside, PHGY is a wonderful (although difficult) program and I’ve truly enjoyed my moments here. U3 is a strange year, with finishing up the last of our credits, graduation right around the corner and figuring out what comes next. With so many upcoming real-word responsibilities (y i k e s), I’m here to help us enjoy our final year together and make us a big PHGY phamily, with events such as the U3 Grad Dinner, board game and trivia nights and whatever events you guys have in mind!
                            <br/><br/>
                            Finally, as U3 students, I want us to be there to help the rest of PHGY get through their years in this program. I’m really looking forward to helping the Synapse mentorship program connect upper years with incoming PHGY students and making this a great resource for everyone involved!
                            <br/><br/>

                        <p> Hello, my name is Safiya Rizwan and I am running for U2 Rep for PULS 2020-2021. This year I represented PULS as the U1 Rep. You may have seen me around in classes making announcements, in office hours, or at the U1 Phgy Pumpkin Carving event! I have really enjoyed being the U1 rep as it has given me the opportunity to meet more people in physiology and get comfortable with the major. Being in physiology is an interesting experience that I feel should be shared with everyone in the major. As U1 rep, I was able to bring some new U1 physiology students together to share and ask questions about the major and how to make the most of it! U2 has been known to be the toughest year of physiology, with many tears and sleep-deprived nights over Phgy 311. If I were elected as U2 rep, I hope to organize more study-group based events to allow U2’s to be familiar with each other and gain help/advice for our classes. However, school isn’t everything, so I also hope to organize relaxed gatherings like board game night, ice skating, trivia night, or maybe an ice cream social! NTC’s are also the most valuable piece of the U2 phgy classes. As U1 rep, I have dealt with organizing and hiring the NTC editors and releasing organized and correct notes that the Phgy 210 students can rely on. If I were a U2 rep, I would invest my time into making sure each NTC was released with the correct and organized information, and re-release them if the NTC’s aren’t of the best quality. I promise to strive to fulfill all the responsibilities of the U2 rep and I am always around for questions and concerns if appointed for the position!

                            My name is Tapi Simbabure and I am so thrilled to be running for U2 Rep! I have summed up my platform into three points so you can understand exactly what I intend to do as your representative.

                            Academics: We all know the U2 year in physiology can be demanding and challenging as we step into the 300 level PHGY courses. As your rep, I would work hard to support your continued success by ensuring student resources are communicated and readily available to U2s, including NTCs, lecture recordings and forming class Facebook groups. Additionally, I would love to start booking rooms that would provide a space for group studying and collaboration on upcoming assignments and exams.
                            <br/><br/>
                            
                            
                            Community: My involvement in the PULS Social Committee this past year has given me great insight into the events and activities that PHGY students enjoy. I would love to host more events that foster new connections and bonding for U2s. After all, we are all in this together and these would be a great opportunity to have fun, support one another and take mental breaks!
                            <br/><br/>
                            
                            
                            Representation: As your representative, its my responsibility to listen to your concerns, input, and suggestions. I would happily bring these forward to the right people and be your advocate. I am also always just down for a chat, whatever about, and love getting to know more people in physiology.
                            <br/><br/>

                                <h3 class="content">
                                    We know a lot of things are changing very rapidly at the moment given the developing situation of Covid-19. We are monitoring this situation closely and want to inform you of updates to PULS services and operations in the near future. As well, if you are feeling overwhelmed or worried about anything going on, please don’t hesitate to reach out to any member on council – we are here to help you in any way possible.

                                    From one science student to another, please educate and properly inform yourselves on the disease. This is not a time to spread fear and misinformation or complain about minor inconveniences, but to appreciate the privileges we have for living in a city able to adapt so quickly and act to lessen the eventual burden on our health system.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>EVENTS</b>
                                    <br/>
                                    PULS-organized events (Journal Club, U1 Board Game Night, intramurals, PHGY Olympics) have all been cancelled or postponed for the time being. Social distancing is a necessary and crucial measure that we need to take right now and we urge all other student organizations to cancel their large and small-scale events.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>OFFICE HOURS</b>
                                    <br/>
                                    Office hours will be cancelled for the duration of the shutdown, and greatly reduced in the case that McGill reopens.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>NTCs</b>
                                    <br/>
                                    If you are a current subscriber to NTCs offered by PULS, they will be made available to you via Google Drive for the next few weeks.
                                    If you need to purchase a set of NTCs, you will need to message the U1/U2/U3 rep for that class.
