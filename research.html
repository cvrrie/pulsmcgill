                    <h2>Strategies for E-mailing Professors</h2>
                    <h3>1. Make a specific, detailed 'sales pitch'</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demonstrate familiarity with and express interest in the professor’s field of research</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conduct research beforehand (e.g. read their abstracts online)</li>
                            <li>If you plan on doing research in this area in graduate school, mention that. Many professors take on undergraduate students to ‘try out’ future graduate students</li><li>Don’t oversell it at the risk of appearing insincere</li>
                         </ul>
                            <li>Show interest in a specific lab technique you would like to develop</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This will make your application stand out</li>
                                <li>The professor might even redirect you to another lab position better-suited to developing that technique</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Convince the professor you are the best candidate for the position</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Include past experience</li>
                                <li>Mention relevant courses you have taken and your major/year of studies</li>
                                <li>Polish your resume</li>
                                <li>Use resources such as CAPS to improve your resume and interview skills</li>
                                <li>Be prepared to provide CV and transcript if not already attached</li>
                                <li>Highlight your passion for the project, relevant skills (lab techniques) and desirable qualities (organization, timeliness, commitment, etc.)</li>

                        <h3>2. Avoid generic e-mails</h3>

                            <li>Low impact</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>3. Most importantly... see them during their office hours!</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Face-to-face interactions are much more impactful </li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>I e-mailed a lot of professors and met with them to discuss available projects, time commitments and how an undergraduate student could help in their lab. The work was very interesting, and I pursued a graduate degree to continue learning about that field</li>
                        <li>I  attended a conference and stayed at the end to ask questions. I was invited to join that lab and worked there for 3 years studying the cardiovascular system</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span style ="font-style:italic"> How did your research experience differ from your expectations? </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research requires effort and patience</li>

                        <li>Focus on learning from lab technicians and graduate students </li>
                        <li>Demonstrating commitment (consistently showing up, putting in the time) to develop trust will open the door to being promoted to a higher position at the lab </li>
