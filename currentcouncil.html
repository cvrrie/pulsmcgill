                        Hey PHGY fam ♥ I'm Zoe, the President of the best department at McGill! I'm from New York and I love the outdoors and staying active! I am always down for a good hike or a fun ski trip. I have a major sweet tooth that the dentist refuses to remove, but when I am not munching on candy I can be found eating some bomb vegetarian food. You'll find me running around campus doing PULS errands by day or walking around Montreal sporting my Walksafe jacket by night. You may also catch me in Cybertech staring out the window wishing I was outside. I am so excited for this school year! There is nothing in the world that I would rather do than Physiology! I love the PHGY community and sharing it with all of you, so please come stop by during my office hours! I am always down to chat and love making new friends :) It's never too late to join the PHGY family, I hope to see all of you at our PULS events!

                        Hey PHGY fam! I'm Kelsey, your Vice-President this year! I was born and raised in Winnipeg, MB, but also love Montreal. I'm always up for an adventure (or have trouble saying no to friends). I enjoy trying new foods, the colour pink and being a crazy cactus lady. You can probably find me studying on the 5th floor of Schulich or dying on the 6th floor. At PULS events, I'll probably be the one who's over-excitedly cheering and trying to get people to join. I love making new PHGY/IHI friends (and others too #WeAreAllBestFriends), so come visit me or slide into my DMs. I would love for every PHGY student to feel welcome and included, so I hope you all come out to our events and I can't wait to meet you :)

                        Hey PHGY! My name is Elya, and I'm your PULS VP Academic for this year! I am super excited to be part of the PULS council and do things such as; work with the department and you on adding learning resources, address concerns about courses, and help students have more access to research opportunities. Please feel free to drop by my office hours to discuss anything you want to about the Physiology program, or come to PHGY Fridays to talk with the whole council! Have a great year!

                        Hey PHGY Pham! My name is Jamie and after serving as a U1 Rep last year, I can't wait to continue on PULS as your Communications Director! I run the PULS website and will be the one answering your e-mails and messages to the Facebook page. I've lived on the island of Montreal my entire life in a faraway land called the "West Island"... only fellow West Islanders understand the transit pain. Now, there are a few things you should know about me from the get-go... If you mention Harry Potter in my presence, we shall be instant friends. If you dare bring up Game of Thrones, prepare yourself for an hour-long speech about my favorite end-game theories. And, if you casually sing a Disney lyric while we're hanging out, know I will be forced to sing the ENTIRE song from beginning to end. Now that you've been fairly warned, I hope to see you all at PULS events (I'm usually the one napping on the couch)! Let's make this an unforgettable year! ♥ ♥ ♥

I'm super excited to be here for you and make sure that everyone's (or almost everyone's) last year at McGill will be unforgettable! I'm from a small town in France between lakes and mountains called Annecy (the most beautiful city in the world) but traveled around quite a bit before ending up here in Montreal! I love sports in general but more specifically swimming and ice hockey (Go Habs Go)! You'll probably find me early in the morning at the memorial pool, around the McIntyre/Bellini buildings during the day or at PHGY Friday at the end of the week! I can't wait to meet you all at any of our awesome PHGY events and wish you an amazing year with the PHGY family!

I've been here for 3 years now so I'm kind of used to it but I miss not having to check the forecast every morning to decide how many layers I'm putting on. Catch me making sure PHGY 311 and 314 are recorded/living in the library. Stop me after class or drop by the PULS office if you ever want to talk about anything!

                        Hey Pham! I'm Anna, one of your U1 Reps this year. I grew up in Alberta and my family's originally from Poland, but my heart is definitely in Montreal. I love all things outdoors and am always down to go exploring when I'm not trying new brunch places. You can probably find me desperately trying to run my meal plan into the ground or studying and secretly snacking in Burnside's basement when I'm not bouncing from the lab bench to the clinic. I'm super excited to meet everyone, so feel free to blast me on social media (DMs are always open), visit me or just say hi!
                        <br /><br />

                        Hi PHGY and IHI fam! I'm Isabelle, the IHI rep for this year! I am from Burlington Vermont, right across the border. I love hiking, exploring MTL, and running! My favorite place to run in MTL is on the bike path along the canal towards Atwater. Feel free to message me if you are interested in IHI or just want to know what it is! I can't wait to meet you all!!!
