                    Hey PHGY pham! I'm Sakiko, the President of the best department at McGill this year! I'm from Japan, although I've spent roughly half my life in the States. You'll most likely see me running around campus (because none of my classes are recorded anymore rip), anywhere with food, and uh, looking for more places with food! Can't wait to meet you all at our events and feel free to hit me up whenever (#weareallbestfriends), whether it be about PHGY or anything else! I'm always down to chat and love making new friends :)

                    It's never too late to join the PHGY family, I hope to see all of you at our PULS events <3

                    Hey PHGY fam ♥ I'm Zoe, the President of the best department at McGill! I'm from New York and I love the outdoors and staying active! I am always down for a good hike or a fun ski trip. I have a major sweet tooth that the dentist refuses to remove, but when I am not munching on candy I can be found eating some bomb vegetarian food. You'll find me running around campus doing PULS errands by day or walking around Montreal sporting my Walksafe jacket by night. You may also catch me in Cybertech staring out the window wishing I was outside. I am so excited for this school year! There is nothing in the world that I would rather do than Physiology! I love the PHGY community and sharing it with all of you, so please come stop by during my office hours! I am always down to chat and love making new friends :) It's never too late to join the PHGY family, I hope to see all of you at our PULS events!

                    Sup PHGY fam! My name is Camy and after serving as U2 Rep last year, I am so excited to continue on PULS and be your VP Academic! This year, I will be working on supporting the PHGY community in their academics by getting feedback from students, working with the department, hosting various academic events and running journal club. This is why I urge you to stop by my office hours to discuss your experience in the physiology program so I can have a better idea of issues that need to be addressed. When I’m not studying, I spend my time rushing around campus from one activity to another, watching Netflix, going on runs on Mount Royal and eating so much ice cream. I am so excited to meet more PHGY friends this year. Hope to see you at PHGY Friday!

This includes being responsible for managing volunteering opportunities, charity projects, and events related to SUS’s annual Charity Month. Don’t hesitate to visit during my office hours or contact me online to discuss any questions or concerns regarding Physiology or other general inquiries. Good luck this year, hope to see you soon!

                    Hey PHGY fam ♥ I'm Zoe, the President of the best department at McGill! I'm from New York and I love the outdoors and staying active! I am always down for a good hike or a fun ski trip. I have a major sweet tooth that the dentist refuses to remove, but when I am not munching on candy I can be found eating some bomb vegetarian food. You'll find me running around campus doing PULS errands by day or walking around Montreal sporting my Walksafe jacket by night. You may also catch me in Cybertech staring out the window wishing I was outside. I am so excited for this school year! There is nothing in the world that I would rather do than Physiology! I love the PHGY community and sharing it with all of you, so please come stop by during my office hours! I am always down to chat and love making new friends :) It's never too late to join the PHGY family, I hope to see all of you at our PULS events!

I love baking, skiing, and finding the best brunch places in Montreal (always looking for suggestions). As I mourn the closure of Schulich, I'm still in search for my next great study spot, but for now you will have to look for me on second floor Redpath.

My parents are from Nova Scotia and Pakistan, but I was born and lived in Tokyo, Japan for 11 years! I moved to Dubai for most of my teenage life, where I grew accustomed to the comfortable heat before being thrown into Montreal’s frigid winters. I’m usually seen by any samosa sale, as its usually my comfort food when cracking down on Org 1!

I love to exercise by lifting heavy objects and running up Mont Royal! I’m always down to discover what Montreal has to offer outside the McGill bubble, especially when it involves food. Feel free to say hi whenever you see me whether it’s in class, at PULS events, or at the gym! I’m excited to meet and connect with you all, so message me on social media or visit me during my office hours if you have any questions are just want to say hi

                    Hi PHGY friends! I’m Laura, your IHI Rep from PULS this year. I was born and raised in Montreal, and lived in Australia for 2 years before starting U1 in Physiology at McGill. (#PHGYpham) I am now in the Interdepartmental Honours Immunology (IHI) program (“uh, what’s that?”). If you have any questions about the IHI program, need help planning next summer’s Australia trip, or just to practice your French: I’m here for it! Super excited to meet you all!
